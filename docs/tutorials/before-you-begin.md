# Before You Begin

Before you can run any tutorials for the **Furniture Style Sleuth API**, you need to set up your development environment.

Expect this setup to take around **20 minutes**.

## Prerequisites

To complete the tutorials, install or access the following:

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com)
- A development system running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Required software:
  - [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
  - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) *(optional but helpful)*
  - A fork of the [Furniture Style Sleuth repo](https://github.com/rachaelallen91/furniture-style-sleuth-docs)
  - A current or LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
  - [`json-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server), version 0.17.4
  - A current copy of the `furniture-db.json` file *(available from your fork)*
  - [Postman desktop app](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) *(required — the web version won’t work with localhost)*

## Tip

Work in a dedicated branch for each tutorial to avoid conflicts.

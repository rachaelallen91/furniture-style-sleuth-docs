# Base URL

The base URL for the Furniture Style Sleuth API is typically: http://localhost:3000


In the API reference, endpoints are shown using a `{base_url}` placeholder, like:

{base_url}/furniture
{base_url}/styles


This placeholder indicates that the `json-server` tool allows you to configure the port number. By default, it's `3000`, but it can be changed if needed.

If this were a real cloud-hosted service, the base URL might look like:

https://api.furniture-style-sleuth.com/v1
